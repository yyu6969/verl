"Im trying to make an if statement like this:\n\n```\nif(boolean1 AND boolean2 AND boolean3 == true){\n   [Do this....]\n}\n\n```\n\nis there a way to do an if statement in that format or will i have to do it like this:\n\n```\nif(boolean1 = true & boolean2 = true ect...){}\n\n```"

"Least you can get is \n\n```\nif(boolean1 && boolean2 && boolean3 &&..){\n\n}\n\n```\n\nBecause since they are already booleans you need not to check for their value. Afaik, no other simple way. \n\nIf you have toooooooo many, create an array and write a simple util method to check if any is `false`"

--- response_k ---
"Yes, but you need two `&`(s) for logical and (one is a bitwise and). Also, one equals is assignment (you need two, or none). Something like,\n\n```\nif (boolean1 && boolean2 && boolean3){\n    // ...\n}\n\n```"

"I am using Hangfire and like the software very much! But one thing I am missing is how to add a recurring job that executes every few minutes (e.g. every 15 minutes). Is there a way to achieve this?"
